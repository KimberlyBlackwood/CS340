1.How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 
Modular Code Design – code is broken down into modular components, functions, or classes each has its own  purpose. 
Clear and Descriptive Variable Names - meaningful variable names are used to increase readability. 
Comments - comments  provides logic and context for the code.
Consistent Style – using  a consistent coding style makes the code easy to maintain and read. 
Error Handling – having a robust error handling provides instructional error messages. 

Testing - unit tests to verify the  CRUD module is correct and free from bugs. 

What were the advantages of working in this way? 
Reusable – developers can reuse  CRUD module across different projects and applications. 

Maintainable – the code is modular; documentation makes it easy to extend and maintain.

Readable - variable names, comments, are descriptive and a consistent coding style improve code readability, this makes the code accessible to all users.

Adaptable -  the module is designed to be adaptable to different databases. 

How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
In the future I can use the CRUD Python module to collaborate with my coworkers. The module can be shared and maintained which increases productivity and reduce product downtime.

2.How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
As a computer scientist I will approach a problem by following these steps:
Understanding the problem 
Analyzing  the requirements
Reading error message well
Planning the next steps to take.
Designing the code by industry standards.
Implementing the changes 
Testing for bugs

Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
For the Grazioso Salvare project I was assigned to  interact with clients to understand their needs. I had to deliver solutions according to what their  requirements were. The experience of working for a real client gave me a different approach that is not present in most of my other courses which may focus on theory.

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
In the future the techniques that I will use to meet client request is to conduct client interviews and requirements gathering. This will provide an understanding of the client’s goals and needs. 

3.What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists are very important in our modern-day society, they create advance technology, solve complex problems, and improve various aspects of our lives.

Computer Scientists:

Cybersecurity -  protects data and networks from cyber-attacks. They create encryption techniques and develop security rules. 

Analyze Data -  analyze datasets to identify trends, make decisions, and extract valuable insights.  

Design Algorithm – computer scientists create algorithms which are step-by-step instructions for computers to follow to perform a task.

Develop Software – write design, develop, maintain software, ensure software are functional and reliable.

Manage database -  computer scientists manage, develop and design databases that retrieve and store data.

Some of the ways in which working on this type of project will help a company like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better us by providing efficient data retrieval, visualization of data, and scalability. This will save the company time and money, making the work reliable and profitable.
